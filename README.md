# foodie_bot
foodieBot is a lightweight yet intelligent food ordering assistant built using Streamlit, LangChain, and the Mistral-7B Instruct model via Together.ai. It allows users to view a menu, place food orders using natural language, and stores orders in a local SQLite database â€” all through a clean, right-aligned, image-backed UI.
